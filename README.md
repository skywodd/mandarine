# Yet another music player inspired by Clementine
## By Skywodd & jordanVertaure

This project is a music player written in C++ using the Qt4 framework.
We use the QtMobility framework from Qt and especialy the QtMultimediaKit to handle music playing and other stuff like ID3 tags.

### Remarks

It's a school project, does not except to see a fully featured and functional music player ;)

This project is (very) inspired by the "Clementine" music player.
Ok, in fact we have cloned the whole gui and functionnality of Clementine in less efficient and more bugged code ...
Take a look at http://www.clementine-player.org/ if you want to see a "real" (and working) music player.
